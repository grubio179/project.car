                        The Tesla Model Y is an upcoming electric compact crossover utility vehicle (CUV) in development by Tesla, Inc.It was unveiled in March 2019, with deliveries planned to begin in summer 2020. It is Tesla's second vehicle built upon the tier-3 mass-market-vehicle platform, alongside the Model 3. Model Y will offer optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity.

                        Like the Model 3, the 2020 Model Y will eventually be available in the cost-leader Standard Range trim, but the first variants to launch will be the Long Range and Performance models. Long Range models can be fitted with either rear- or all-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is standard on the Model Y Performance. The Performance model will offer slightly less range (280 miles versus 300, according to Tesla), but it comes with 20-inch wheels, a lowered suspension, a higher top speed (150 mph), and a dedicated Track mode. When the Standard Range variant becomes available, buyers can expect a driving range of about 230 miles.
